<p>It's been over 10 years since my last update...haha. I just started playing TFC again and got all my custom stuff configured the way I like it. I know people still play my maps and use my custom TFC things, so I wanted to put all of it on the internet again. This was my latest custom TFC webpage, but it's still missing some stuff. I don't have ss_shortcut in the maps section, so I'll try to get on that. I also have many smaller mappy tidbits that I never did anything with and I think I'll put something about them up too. Anyway, see you all on Drippy's 2fort!</p>

<tr><td>
<p>I added another tutorial on how to create awesome outdoor environments in Half-Life. I've had it sitting on my harddrive as a word document for years, and I actually forgot about it, so I figured I should put it on my site for all to see. It is a long read, but definatly worth it. I didn't write the tutorial, I just converted it to HTML. You can get to it from the misc section or just use <a href="rocks/index_mypage.html">this direct link</a>.</p>

<p>I made some new crosshairs. :) Instigator requested that I make my version 4 crosshairs a little bit larger, because they get blurry in steam. After a couple hours worth of work, I finished them. I like them a lot actually. They are much easier to see in steam, which is good. I also changed the design of the super nailgun and the autorifle a little bit. Other than that, they are the same designs as version 4, so I named them version 4b. Get them <a href="sprites_xhairs.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sorry I havn't updated in a while. A lot has changed in the TFC world. Many of the customizers have stopped making stuff, and fresh ideas are hard to come by. This is where I come in. :)</p>
<p>I moved up to Seattle a couple months ago, and I havn't been able to play TFC much because I've been looking for a job. Now that I have a job, I can barely make any matches with my clan, and it sucks. :(</p>
<p>I did manage to make a new skin for the spy however. It is based off the old spy skin for original TF. I didn't look at any screenshots of it or anything though. All I knew is he was in a suit. (I never actually played the original TF for Quake1). Personally, I think it's one of my best works. You can go to the models page, or grab it directly <a href="models/spy_suit.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>I added in another color scale to the color scales zip I have in the <a href="misc.html">misc page</a>. This one is a combination of all three color scales, so you can make a hud with multiple colors.</p>

<p>A couple days ago, I checked the hits on the page and it was around 19,000. I checked this morning, and it's now 20,227! That's pretty neato. In celebration of this I'll finish up the red posing models. :)</p>

<tr><td>
<p>I'm at work, bored out of my mind, so I decided to update my page. :) I went to all the links and made sure they work. Sexkitten's site is now down, and I had to change someone else's to the right URL, but they should all be working now. I also went through to each site looking for links buttons, and added them if they had any. You other tfc customizers need to make buttons! I don't have one for <b>any</b> of you! Not even <a href="http://www.custom-tfc.co.uk" target="_blank">custom-tfc</a>! Bah!</p>

<p>Another update complete. After I put my face on the scout, I put Lloyd's face on the spy. I actually forgot I was even using it, so it slipped my mind for an update. It's in the <a href="models.html">models section</a>.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely I'll be updating the site with new content. Today, I took the tutorial I wrote about making translucent weapons and put it on my page. I formatted it all purdy and put stuff in boxes and everything. It's much easier to read. I put it in the misc section under the new sub-section, tutorials. Hope you like it!</p>

<p>I'm finally done converting all the old content to the new site. After it is all said and done, I <b>really really really</b> like this site's design. It works perfectly for the stuff I have. Anyway, I hope to update it with the newest stuff I made soon. All I have to do is get all that new stuff together and make pictures of them and stuff like that.</p>

<tr><td>
<p>Yup, I made a new site. I <b>really</b> like the design this time, so I'll probably keep it for a while. The images used to make up the site are also a lot smaller, so my host should like that. (Thanks Ribo!)</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a lot more stuff to put on this site. I just gotta be unlazy enough to do it. Hopefully I'll have the page finished by tomorrow, then I can update it with new stuff.</p>
